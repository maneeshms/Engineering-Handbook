We follow [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) - which means :
1. Every piece of code we write must be tested automatically (than just manually).
2. We write test cases "before" working code is developed. Worst case is that we write test cases after developing a working code. But in this case we do not want working code to got into git repository without accompaying its test cases

We couple it with [Continuous Integration](CICD) - which ensures that everytime someone in our team pushes their commit into git repository their commits are tested against the automated test cases before their code is merged into the repository

We could have done Unit Testing - where we have to test each and every function of code. But instead of going into such depth in detail, we rather test higher level 'test cases'. 

There are testing frameworks in every programming language. Following is an incomplete list of frameworks that you can consider.

* Python : 
* Javascript : MochaJS

In addition to using testing framework suited for your language, we also augument our test suite with 'end to end' testing frameworks such as
* Cypress.io
* or Selenium
